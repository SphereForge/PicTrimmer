**Last Updated:** 28 July 2025

Thank you for using PicTrimmer. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled.

### 1. Information I Do Not Collect

PicTrimmer is designed to function entirely on your device. I do not collect, store, or transmit any of your photos or images. All image processing performed by the App happens locally on your phone. Your images are never uploaded or seen by me.

### 2. Information Collected by Advertising Partners

To support the App and keep it free, I work with third-party advertising partners to display advertisements.

My advertising partners are:
*   Unity Ads
*   ironSource (now part of Unity)

With your consent, these partners may collect and process certain data from your device to provide you with personalized and relevant advertising. This data may include:

*   **Device Identifiers:** Such as your Android Advertising ID (GAID).
*   **General Location Data:** Non-precise location, such as country or city, may be inferred from your IP address.
*   **Technical Information:** Information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.
*   **Ad Engagement Data:** Information about the ads you have seen and interacted with.

This data is used by them to serve ads that are more likely to be of interest to you and to help them measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Declining consent will not stop ads from being shown, but they may be less relevant to your interests.

### 3. How This Information Is Used

The information collected by my advertising partners is used solely for the following purposes:

*   **To monetize the App:** Displaying ads allows me to offer PicTrimmer to you for free.
*   **To Personalize Advertising:** To show ads that are more relevant to you.
*   **For Analytics and Reporting:** To measure ad performance and understand how users interact with ads.

### 4. Your Consent Choices

On the first launch of the App, you are presented with a consent dialog. This dialog gives you the choice to either accept or decline the collection and use of your data for personalized advertising. You can change your consent choice at any time from within the app's ads settings.

### 5. Data Security

I do not collect or store your data. For the data collected by my advertising partners, I rely on their respective security measures to protect the information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access.

You are encouraged to review their privacy policy for more details on their security practices:
*   **Unity (for Unity Ads & ironSource):** [https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy](https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy)

### 6. Children's Privacy

This app is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). I do not knowingly collect any personal information from children through my advertising partners.

If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided data for personalized ads without their consent, they can prevent further use of this data by managing the device's Advertising ID. This option is typically found in the device's main Settings app, under the Google section, within the Ads menu.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

### 8. Contact & Bug Reports

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to report a bug, please do so by creating an issue on the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/SphereForge/PicTrimmer/issues](https://github.com/SphereForge/PicTrimmer/issues)
