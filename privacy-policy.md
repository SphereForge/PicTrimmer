**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025

Thank you for using PicTrimmer. Your privacy is important. This policy explains how information is handled in the different versions of the PicTrimmer application.

**About PicTrimmer Versions:**
*   **PicTrimmer (Free):** This version is supported by third-party advertising.
*   **PicTrimmer Pro (Paid):** This version is ad-free.

### 1. Core App Functionality (All Versions)

PicTrimmer is designed to function entirely on your device. The application does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal photos or images. All image processing performed by the App happens locally on your phone. Your images are never uploaded to any server or seen by the developer.

### 2. PicTrimmer Pro (Paid Version)

The paid "Pro" version of PicTrimmer does not contain any advertising libraries or third-party tracking analytics. Therefore, the sections of this policy related to advertising data handling do not apply to users of PicTrimmer Pro. No data is collected by the developer or any third party in the Pro version.

### The following sections apply ONLY to the Free version of PicTrimmer.

### 3. Data Handling (Advertising)

To support the App and keep it free, the free version of PicTrimmer integrates third-party advertising services.

Our advertising partners are:
*   Unity Ads
*   ironSource (now part of Unity)

With user consent, these services may collect and process certain data from the user's device to provide personalized and relevant advertising. The developer of PicTrimmer does not access, store, or manage this data directly. This data may include:

*   **Device Identifiers:** Such as your Android Advertising ID (GAID).
*   **General Location Data:** Non-precise location, such as country or city, may be inferred from your IP address.
*   **Technical Information:** Information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.
*   **Ad Engagement Data:** Information about the ads you have seen and interacted with.

This data is used by the advertising partners to serve ads that are more likely to be of interest to you and to help them measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Declining consent will not stop ads from being shown, but they may be less relevant to your interests.

### 4. How Advertising Data Is Used

The information collected by the advertising partners is used by them for the following purposes:

*   **To monetize the App:** Displaying ads allows us to offer PicTrimmer to you for free.
*   **To Personalize Advertising:** To show ads that are more relevant to you.
*   **For Analytics and Reporting:** To measure ad performance and understand how users interact with ads.

### 5. Your Consent Choices

On the first launch of the free version of the App, users are presented with a consent dialog. This dialog gives you the choice to either accept or decline the collection and use of your data for personalized advertising. You can change this choice at any time from within the app's settings.

### 6. Data Security

As stated, the core functionality of PicTrimmer does not collect or store your data. For the data collected by advertising partners in the free version, we rely on their respective security measures to protect the information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access.

You are encouraged to review their privacy policy for more details on their security practices:
*   **Unity (for Unity Ads & ironSource):** [https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy](https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy)

### 7. Children's Privacy

This app is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). The developer does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If advertising partners collect data in the free version, it is done in accordance with their policies regarding children's privacy.

If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided data for personalized ads without their consent, they can prevent further use of this data by managing the device's Advertising ID. This option is typically found in the device's main Settings app, under the Google section, within the Ads menu.

### The following sections apply to ALL versions of PicTrimmer.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
